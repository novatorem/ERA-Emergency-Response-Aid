• State your team’s numerical series you do intend to use to estimate user stories (as you did in week 7
tutorial)

• Identify the most important user stories.

• How many user stories? We are not sure. Enough to give us (and you) a good sense of the scope of
the project.

• As a guideline: a user story (usually) corresponds to a feature in your project.

• Any number between 3 and 20 might be appropriate.

• Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the criteria of
satisfaction.

• Each user story should include a priority and a point estimate (using the numerical scale stated above).
